Our player interface currently is a dummy/placeholder interface that allows room for behaviors to be added to any type of player, such as human and AI.
Players are represented in the model through an enum PlayerOwnership.
We envision passing them into the controller as an entry point and then the controller can pass the players down to the model or potentially view.
