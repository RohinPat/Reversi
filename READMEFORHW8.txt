Overview
This document provides an overview of the features and functionalities implemented in our recent project. The project focused on integrating a range of features from our system with those from a provider's system, ensuring seamless operation and enhanced usability.

Features Successfully Implemented
    - Providers View Integration:
        Achieved full integration of the provider's view with our system.
        Ensured compatibility and seamless functionality.
    - View Customizations:
        Successfully incorporated the provider's color schemes into our system.
        Implemented 'invalid move' pop-ups as per the provider's design.
    - Gameplay Enhancements:
        Integrated key commands such as 'M' for move and 'P' for pass from the provider's system.
            We used 'M' for move but use 'space' for pass which was different from their design so now each interface uses their intended models.
        Enabled an end-game screen similar to the provider's design, enhancing the user experience.
    - Strategy Implementations:
        Successfully incorporated all the provider's strategies into our system.
        Enabled the use of our strategies within the provider's view.
        Facilitated the use of the provider's strategies within our view.
        Implemented the ability to combine our strategies with those of the provider's, offering a versatile gameplay experience.
